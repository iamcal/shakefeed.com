# ShakeFeed - Best of MLKSHK on a page

I follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/best_of_mlkshk">Best of MLKSHK</a> stream, but it's hard to remember where I left off last time.
Have I seen this image in this feed before, or just randomly?

This super simple app just shows the feed as text links, letting my browser remember what I've seen.

## Installation

    ./install.php https://github.com/iamcal/shakefeed.com

Add the OAuth key and user secrets into `secrets/oauth_secret` and `secrets/oauth_user_secret`.

The crontab is not currently hooked up, since mlkshk is no longer online.
