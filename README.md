# ShakeFeed - Best of MLTSHP on a page

I follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/best_of_mltshp">Best of MLTSHP</a> stream, but it's hard to remember where I left off last time.
Have I seen this image in this feed before, or just randomly?

This super simple app just shows the feed as text links, letting my browser remember what I've seen.

Switched from MLKSHK to MLTSHP, finally, in Jan 2018.


## Installation

    ./install.php https://github.com/iamcal/shakefeed.com
